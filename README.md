# Crop Recommendation System

This project uses the TensorFlow library to build an AI model that recommends which crop to grow based on soil nutrition and weather conditions. The data for this project is stored in the `Crop_recommendation.csv` file.

## Introduction

The Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers decide which crop to plant based on the nutritional content of the soil and the prevailing weather conditions. 
The model is trained using a dataset that includes various soil nutrients and weather parameters.
